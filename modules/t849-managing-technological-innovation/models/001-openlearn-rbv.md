## 1. Key questions

1. How has the Resource-Based View (RBV) of organisations evolved, and what are its core contributions and limitations—particularly in relation to innovation and risk?
2. What are the distinctions between resources, competences, and capabilities—and how do these shape an organisation’s innovation strategy and competitive advantage?
3. How are innovation-related capabilities developed, structured, and sustained over time and what causes them to ossify into core rigidities?
4. What roles do knowledge management and organisational learning play in the development, renewal, or erosion of organisational capabilities?
5. To what extent do organisational risk aversion, routinisat9ion, and environmental shifts contribute to inertia and declining productivity?

## 2.Notes

### 2.1 The nature of innovation

#### 2.1.1 Definition and Process

* **Innovation** is a process from **invention** to **diffusion**, influenced by both technological development (_push_) and societal needs (_pull_). (BIS, 2011; OECD, 2018; Rogers, 2003)
* The coupling model of innovation (Rothwell, 1992) illustrates this dual influence.

#### 2.1.2 Types of Innovation

* Product innovation
* Process innovation
* Marketing innovation
* Organisational innovation

(OECD, 2018)

#### 2.1.3 Discontinuous Innovation

* Triggered by significant environmental shifts that destabilise the status quo (Bessant et al., 2009)
* Often leads to radical changes in markets or organisations

#### 2.1.4 First Movers vs Long-Term Success

* Organisations that are first to exploit innovations are not always the most successful in the long run (Rogers, 2003; von Hippel, 2005)

### 2.2 Understanding the Resource-Based View (RBV)

#### 2.2.1 VRIN: What is a competitive advantage?

Competitive advantage stems from unique internal resources and capabilities that are:

* Valuable
* Rare
* Inimitable
* Non-substitutable

#### 2.2.2 Dynamic Capabilities

* The ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address changing environments (Teece et al., 1997)

#### 2.2.3 Strategic Drift and Necessity

* Once widespread, an innovation or resource no longer provides competitive advantage—it becomes a strategic necessity

### 2.3 Resources, competences, and capabilities

#### 2.3.1 Definitions

* **Resources**: Assets controlled by the firm
* **Competences**: Organisational and technical skills to apply resources (Boisot, 1998)
* **Capabilities**: The ability to deploy competences to achieve outcomes

#### 2.3.2 Strategic Resources and VRIN

* Identified using the VRIN framework

#### 2.3.3 Core Competences

* Provide access to a variety of markets
* Contribute significantly to customer-perceived value
* Are difficult to imitate

(Prahalad & Hamel, 1990)

#### 2.3.4 Complementary Assets

* Enhance the value of core competences (Teece, 1986)

#### 2.3.5 Capability Hierarchy

1. **Supplemental** – universally available (e.g. open-source software)
2. **Enabling** – necessary but not sufficient for advantage
3. **Core** – source of competitive advantage

(Leonard 1995)

#### 2.3.6 Core Rigidities

* Core capabilities can ossify and become rigidities
* Causes include:
  * Risk-averse managerial systems
  * Resistant values and norms
  * Organisational insularity ("not invented here" syndrome)

(Leonard, 1995)

### 2.4 The anatomy of a capability

#### 2.4.1 Four Dimensions

1. **Skills & Knowledge** – public, industry, firm-specific (decreasing transferability)
2. **Technical Systems** – tangible systems used by employees
3. **Managerial Systems** – decision rules, reporting lines
4. **Values & Norms** – organisational culture and routines
   * _Organisational routines_ - Capabilities are executed through routines shaped by experience
   * _Organisational learning_ - Learning is the process by which firms build, organise, and improve capabilities (Dodgson et al., 2008)

(Leonard, 1995)

### 2.5 Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning

#### 2.5.1 Tacit vs Explicit Knowledge

* **Tacit**: Embedded in experience, difficult to articulate
* **Explicit**: Codified and transferable

#### 2.5.2 Boisot’s Knowledge Dimensions

* **Codification** – formalisation of knowledge
* **Abstraction** – generalisability to other contexts
* **Diffusion** – how widely knowledge is shared

(Bosiot, 1998)

#### 2.5.3 Codification trade-offs

* While codification can improve knowledge transfer and reuse, it risks entrenchment, and so increasing rigidity in risk-averse organisations

## 2.6 Potential Criticisms of the Resource-Based View

_Adapted from Kraaijenbrink, Spender & Groen (2010)_

### 2.6.1 Lack of Managerial Guidance

* RBV identifies the characteristics of strategic resources (VRIN), but offers no guidance on how to find, develop, or manage them
* Assumes managers have perfect knowledge of a firm’s resource base and strategic environment
* **Implication**: Limits RBV's utility as a practical framework for decision-making

### 2.6.2 Infinite Regress Problem

* Capabilities to innovate rely on capabilities to build capabilities—raising questions of endless higher-order capabilities
* This implies a potentially unresolvable recursion (e.g. capability to develop a capability to develop...)
* **Implication**: Undermines clarity on where strategic efforts should focus and how capability-building is bounded

### 2.6.3 Limited Applicability and Generalisability

* By focusing on uniqueness, RBV resists generalisation; what is unique cannot form the basis of general theory
* Neglects smaller firms or contexts where success depends on adaptability or relationships, not static resources
* Ignores firms content with their existing market position
* **Implication**: RBV may be overly academic and inapplicable to many real-world organisations

### 2.6.4 Sustainability of Competitive Advantage Is Unrealistic

* RBV assumes SCA is possible, yet environments are dynamic and competitors can imitate or leapfrog
* Fails to address the temporal limits of resource advantages
* **Implication**: In fast-moving markets, competitive advantage is likely transient-not sustained

### 2.6.5 RBV Is Not a Theory of the Firm

* RBV explains why firms differ in performance but not why firms exist or how they are structured
* **Implication**: RBV has limited explanatory power about organisational form or boundaries
* **Open question**: Should RBV aim to be a theory of the firm, or remain a theory of strategic advantage?

### 2.6.6 VRIN/O Is Neither Necessary Nor Sufficient for SCA

* Empirical support for the VRIN framework is inconsistent and context-dependent
* RBV does not explain how resources are integrated and used effectively—it assumes they simply are.
* Assumes managers can foresee the future value of resources
* **Implication**: RBV may overemphasise possession over action (deployment, combination, timing)

### 2.6.7 The Value of Resources Is Too Indeterminate

* RBV can be tautological: firms succeed because they have valuable resources; we know the resources are valuable because the firm succeeds
* Lacks predictive precision; path-dependency is implied but underexplored
* **Implication**: Weakens RBV’s scientific status as a theory due to lack of falsifiability

### 2.6.8 The Concept of ‘Resource’ Is Overly Broad

* The term "resource" is too inclusive—everything from brand to culture to managerial insight can qualify
* Capabilities to manage resources are themselves treated as resources, blurring distinctions
* **Implication**: Conceptual muddiness limits analytical precision; a clearer taxonomy (e.g. separating assets, competences, capabilities) would improve usefulness

**Organisational Routine**
: Regular, patterned behaviour embedded in organisational processes; a basis for capabilities.

**Resource**
: A tangible or intangible asset owned or controlled by an organisation that can be used to produce value (e.g., patents, equipment, brand equity, or skilled staff).

**Resource-Based View (RBV)**
: A strategic management theory that argues competitive advantage stems from internal resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN).

**Risk aversion**
